##  üêç Bieda-Snake üêç

This repo contains a simple HTML/JS project which is a clone of beloved Nokia game classic, snake.

It was created as a mini project during my September 2021 holiday. This little hack was made in order to: 
- Get better at writing OOP with JS,
- See how things can be done with pure HTML, CSS and JS (as so far, in my professional settings I only worked on angular and react front-end projects),
- Improve my CSS styling skills (without usage of resources such as Material UI or Bootstrap).

As it is only a `hack` project, any sort fo testing was omitted.

- To track your progress, check the `top-left` corner of the phone screen (see image below) for your current score.
- To play the game, use `arrow keys` on your keyboard.
- The script has the ability to save the high score (`top-middle` of the phone screen) for the current game session (using browser's `sessionStorage`.
